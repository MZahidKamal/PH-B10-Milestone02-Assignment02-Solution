# PH-B10 Milestone 02: Assignment 02 Solution

This was the assignment for the second milestone of the 10th batch of the Web Development course by Programming Hero. Along with basic HTML, mid-level CSS was taught in this milestone, and this small page was created using that. No frameworks were used at all.

The page was created only for desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. This means it is not fully responsive for all devices. It can be called partially responsive. As a result, the design structure may break on some displays.

This will remain just as an assignment, and there are no plans to update it.
